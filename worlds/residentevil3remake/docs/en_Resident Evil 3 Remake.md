## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and
export a config file.

## Important Tips
* Use teleports sparingly, and do not teleport to Downtown areas after fighting Nemesis at the Demolition Site.
* Do not switch save files, or you may lose items.
* Save often. Save after boss fights.
* When you complete a randomizer, restart your game before starting another one.
