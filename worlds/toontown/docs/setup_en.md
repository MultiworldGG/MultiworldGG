# Toontown Randomizer for MWGG - Setup Guide

## Video Tutorial

A Video tutorial is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJTC7A5OFTE) outlining the steps for setting up the game and the randomizer.

## Required Software

* [Toontown AP](https://github.com/toontown-archipelago/toontown-archipelago/releases/latest)

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

* Extract the TTAP Zip file to a folder of your choice
* Open the folder and run `start_servers.bat`. This will make some windows appear, do not close these during gameplay!
* To start the game, run `start_client.bat`. This will open a window that will help you set up your client.
* Where it says "Username", enter a name unique to you. You should enter this same name everytime you play. Then press enter.
* Where it says "Server IP", enter the IP address of the server. Then press enter. If you're running the server locally, just press enter without typing anything.
* When in game, you first need to type (in Toontown's chat) !slot <SLOT NAME> where you replace <SLOT NAME> with whatever your slot is in the Multiworld room. 
* Type !connect <MWGG SERVER IP> to play!
