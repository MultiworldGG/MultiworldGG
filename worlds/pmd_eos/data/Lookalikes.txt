“special rift” is to make it loop endlessly until you leave or faint - lappy

Blizzard Iceland
blizzard iceland has the same encounter pool as either frosty forest or mt. freeze from rescue team
and also loops
no bananas in the walls though
No. But alternatively: it is always hailing, and there are no ice-types on the floor

Temprate Tower (looks the same as temporal tower but with added fire types that presumably replace some of the encounters. or just sun idk)

Zero Isle Weast
Area Zero Isle

Obvious forest - opposite of oblivion forest so it fills your pack fully (probably with junk) but your pack has to be empty to leave
Steamy Cave - Just sends you to hot spring
Craggy Cost: lose all your held money and $500 bank gold on entry

Darker Crater: its identical to dark crater but with no boss
this is so cresselia wastes your reviver seeds before you realize you went to the wrong dungeon

Buttonless Sea, one random button is not available (pray it isn't the A button, or one of the directional ones)
