# Resident Evil 2 Remake Randomizer for MWGG

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and
export a config file.

## Important Tips
* Don't use typewriter teleports to skip either the Helicopter or the Mr. X arrival scenes, or to leave/skip any of the G fights. YOU WILL HARDLOCK.
* Don't enter any non-Ada cutscenes while Ada is following you. YOU WILL HARDLOCK.
* Do not switch save files when playing the same seed, or you may lose items.
* Save often. Save after boss fights.
