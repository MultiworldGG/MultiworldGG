# Setup Guide for Resident Evil 2 Remake Randomizer for MWGG

## Visual Guide

* A more thorough, visual guide to set up RE2R Randomizer for MWGG is available [here](https://fuzzygameson.github.io/RE2R_AP_SetupGuide/#connecting)

## Required Software

* Resident Evil 2 Remake (Non-RTX Version)
* [REFramework RE2-TDB66](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework/releases)
* [RE2AR_AP_Client](https://github.com/FuzzyGamesOn/RE2R_AP_Client/releases)

## Initial Setup

* Extract the contents of the REFramework zip file into you RE2R game install's folder
* Extract the contents of the AP Client zip file into your RE2R game install's folder. There should now be a"RE2R_AP_Client-x.x.x" folder.
* Move the contents of that new folder into your game folder. (It should ask you to overwrite the "reframework" folder, choose Yes.)
* Open your game normally and click through until you see the RE2R title screen. If you see both a "REFramework" and a couple of "Archipelago" windows in-game, the install worked!

## Joining a Multiworld Room

* In the "MultiworldGG client for REFramework" window in your game, enter the connection details for your multiworld.
  * "Host" will be the host that is shown in the console (hosting locally) or on the website (hosting there).
  * "Slot" will be the player name that you configured in the "2. YAML Options" step.
  * "Password" can be left empty, unless a password was configured for your generated multiworld. (This is usually not the case.)
* Connect and start playing
