# Mario Kart 64

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## Known Issues
* Difficulty isn't modeled especially well yet. I recommend setting logic_difficulty to generous for your first playthrough.
* Occasional BizHawk crash
* The client occasionally sends an extra item, or does not send an item. This maybe only happens after a crash, or closing without saving.
* If consistent_item_boxes is on or identify, you may not be able to get a Star, Feather, or Fake Item on a level despite logic expecting you to use one for a check.
* Fences get two-sided collision on the course after Kalimari Desert.
* Yoshi Valley has a backwards yellow fence, and Wario Stadium has a backwards blue fence.
* Unchecked location numbers on the cup/course select screen are wrong
* Generation occasionally fails, more often on easier logic_difficulty settings. Increasing shuffle_item_box_clusters and minimum_filler_items can help.
* Start Inventory doesn't work.
