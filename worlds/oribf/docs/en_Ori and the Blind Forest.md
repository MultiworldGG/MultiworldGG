# Ori and the Blind Forest

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and
export a config file.

## Additional Notes

* You can teleport from anywhere in the map to any activated/unlocked Teleporter by pressing `Alt-T`
  - Make sure you acquire Sein and activate the first Teleporter before teleporting for the first time
  - You can freely teleport out of the Ginso escape sequence and come back to it later
  - You can freely teleport out of the Forlorn escape sequence. You won't be able to complete it later, but there aren't any checks besides starting the escape
  - *Don't* teleport about of the Horu escape sequence if you can avoid it. This is a known issue. If you need to, try to do so at the beginning of the sequence. Otherwise, you may softlock yourself
* Keybinds (including `Alt-T` to teleport) can be changed in the Keybinds.txt file. More information about this can be found [here](https://github.com/c-ostic/OriBFArchipelago/blob/main/Keybinds.md)
