# Star Wars Episode I Racer Setup Guide

## Required Software
* Star Wars Episode I Racer (Windows Version)
* [SWR AP Client](https://github.com/wcolding/SWR_AP_Client/releases/tag/v0.6.0)
* [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases)

## Join a Multiworld Room

* Place the Ultimate ASI Loader dll file (dinput or dsound) into your game's main directory
* Place the entire scripts folder from the client release into the main directory as well
  * Note: Place the folder into the main directory, not its contents. ASI Loader is looking for a folder named "scripts"!
* Run the game and a window should pop up asking if you want to connect to Archipelago. Enter the server address and port (e.g.: multiworld.gg:12345), your slot name, and a password if applicable.
* Click Log In. If all goes well you should see "Connected to AP" and a seed number in the upper right hand corner of the game
