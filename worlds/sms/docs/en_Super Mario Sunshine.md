# Super Mario Sunshine
A mod adding Archipelago Multi World support to Super Mario Sunshine

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file. Please note that by default, the website only exposes a couple well known romhacks. If you want to use your custom hack, please generate locally.

## Notes

* You can switch secondary nozzles with the D-Pad. Left for Hover, Right for Turbo and Down for Rocket
* Keep the yoshi setting to skip_pinna for now, it's working in the way that when you receive Yoshi it'll automatically finish Pinna 4, sending out its check if you haven't done it yet
* Nozzle switching is still being worked on, if you start with Spray, you shouldn't be able to switch Nozzles until you get a secondary one, when you do you'll be able to switch to the Hover nozzle, even if you don't have it so keep it at an honor system here
