# Super Mario Sunshine Setup Guide

* Either copy the GMSE01.ini file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Joshark/archipelago-sms/releases/latest) into your Dolphin's GameSettings folder or copy the contents of it into the properities of your iso, in the Editor tab (I'd recommend copying the file into the correct folder, it's easier)
* Make sure you have cheats enabled for Dolphin for these to take effect also
* Start up the game before the Super Mario Sunshine client, I don't think it's been working if the client is open before the game is started, connect and play!
