# An Untitled Story
## Where is the settings page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What is different from the vanilla game?
* Blue orbs (abilities), hearts, gold orbs, flowers, and money bundles (from bosses and flower/RainbowDive rewards) are all randomized.
* Items from other games appear as pink orbs.
* Clearing a boss with max health will still provide the vanilla bonus money reward, but this isn't included in logic as it can be permanently missed.
* You start with the ability to teleport between save points (it is removed from the pool).
* All flower locations are immediately accessible, without completing the NightWalk gauntlet.
Two abilities are now progressive: (Fire Shot -> Range Upgrade), and (Ceiling Stick -> Ceiling Slide).
* For now, the game is locked to Regular difficulty.
