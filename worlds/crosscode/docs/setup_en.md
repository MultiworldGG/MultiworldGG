## Joining a MultiWorld Game
* Open CrossCode and do the following:
    * Enter the Options menu.
    * Press the "mods" hotkey (listed in the top bar of the menu).
    * Search or scroll through the mod list until you find the mod labeled Multiworld randomizer by CodeTriangle with the Archipelago logo as its icon.
    * Select the mod and install it using the button listed at the bottom of the screen.
    * You will be prompted to restart the game. Do that.
* Now, assuming you don't get any errors in the top-right corner, you can start a new save file. Either:
    * Use the Archipelago Start option. You will be prompted for details, then, upon a successful server connection, you will be brought to the New Game+ tab to pick perks.
    * Use the New Game+ Start option. Select your perks and then, once you're in game, pause and click the "Archipelago Options" button and put in your connection details there. Once the pause menu screen says "AP: CONNECTED", you can start playing.
    * If the New Game+ Start option is not available, this is because you do not have a completed CrossCode save file. Please read the first section on this page to learn why. Then, if you're still sure you want to play, ask us for help acquiring a completed save file.
