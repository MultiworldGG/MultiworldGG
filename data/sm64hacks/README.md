# SM64Hacks Romhacks JSON repository

This folder hosts json files to be used with the SM64 APWorld.
JSONs / Hacks that are supposed to be selectable through the webworld frontend need to be lowercased and need to be added to the Options.py of the apworld.
Custom JSONs can be simply copied here and can be provided as custom string or in the host.yaml with the exact name.
