# WebHost

## Contribution Guidelines
**Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MultiworldGG website!**  
Much of the content on the website is generated automatically, but there are some things
that need a personal touch. For those things, we rely on contributions from both the core
team and the community. The current primary maintainer of the website is TreZc0_.

### Small Changes
Little changes like adding a button or a couple new select elements are perfectly fine.
Tweaks to style specific to a PR's content are also probably not a problem. For example, if
you build a new page which needs two side by side tables, and you need to write a CSS file
specific to your page, that is perfectly reasonable.

### Content Additions
Once you develop a new feature or add new content the website, make a pull request. It will
be reviewed by the community and there will probably be some discussion around it. Depending
on the size of the feature, and if new styles are required, there may be an additional step
before the PR is accepted wherein Farrak works with the designer to implement styles.
